The goal of the conference is to provide groups collecting Public Health and Social Measures (PHSMs) data the opportunity to  network, discuss challenges and best practices, establish opportunities for collaboration, and prepare for future pandemics. The conference will also bring together relevant stakeholders from governments, academia, funding, and international organizations to support high-quality, collaborative data collection. We are co-hosting the conference with a consortium of COVID-19 public health and social measures trackers led by **[CoronaNet](https://www.coronanet-project.org/)** and co-hosted by **[ACAPS](https://www.acaps.org/covid-19-government-measures-dataset)**, **[CCCSL](http://covid19-interventions.com/CCCSLgraph/)**, **[HIT-COVID](https://akuko.io/post/covid-intervention-tracking)**, **[OxGCRT](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/covidtracker)** and the **[Oxford Supertracker](https://supertracker.spi.ox.ac.uk/)**.
