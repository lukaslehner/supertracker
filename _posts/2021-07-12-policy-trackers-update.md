Today, we present a major update of the **[policy trackers directory](../policy-trackers/)**. The collection exceeds now over 200 policy trackers that were created since the start of the pandemic. These new sources document measures in nearly all policy domains. Most datasets cover social and employment policy, health and care policy, and non-pharmaceutical interventions. With the new update, the directory also covers areas such as environmental policy, housing, and agricultural policy.

We have also made the Supertracker more user friendly. In addition to policy area, author, country coverage and data type, you can now filter as well by time coverage, provider, source and world region. Time coverage allows you to restrict your search to up-to-date datasets.

Filtering policy trackers by country coverage, you can see that measures in nearly all countries around the world are documented. However, the Global North is covered more in-depth than the Global South.
